This folder contains a few GameMaker Projects. These were mostly used for learning a few specific techniques or works-in-progress. In Adam (Since the controls aren't displayed) Press CTRL+Left Click and CTRL+Right Click to change weapons, and Left and Right Click to fire. These can't run on their own at the moment, but if you want to run them without installing GameMaker let me know and I can create an executable for your OS.
