This folder contains a couple Java projects. I consider the Simple Budget program to be my best work so far. The goal with Keyboard will be to enter the layout of a virtual keyboard (Such as the XBOX Keyboard or Netflix Keyboard) and a String, where the output is the fewest number of key presses to get the desired String, including backspaces and moving the cursor left and right within the input. Not practical, but fun and challenging.
